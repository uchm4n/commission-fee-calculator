[//]: # (- don't forget to change `P***` namespace and package name in `composer.json`)

[//]: # ( to your own, as `P***` keyword should not be used anywhere in your task;)

[//]: # (- `\P***\CommissionTask\Service\Math` is an example class provided for the skeleton and could or could not be used by your preference;)

[//]: # (- needed scripts could be found inside `composer.json`;)

[//]: # (- before submitting the task make sure that all the scripts pass &#40;`composer run test` in particular&#41;;)

[//]: # (- this file should be updated before submitting the task with the documentation on how to run your program.)
